## 💬 KEY PHRASES TO MEMORIZE

### **Opening** (Slide 1):
> "Using explainable AI to quantify socioeconomic influence"

### **Hook** (Slide 2):
> "The scales are imbalanced before care even begins"

### **Problem** (Slide 4):
> "We need to measure the hidden factors below the waterline"

### **Results** (Slide 19):
> "100% recall - we didn't miss a single case"

## 🚨 EMERGENCY CUTS (If Over Time)

**Cut These First:**
- Slide 10 (income distribution)
- Slides 13-14 (correlation details)
- Slide 17 (comorbidity count)

**Never Cut:**
- Slides 2, 4 (problem statement)
- Slides 18-20 (models & SHAP)

---

## ✅ 60-SECOND VERSION (Emergency)

> "We studied 2,568 autistic children to quantify how socioeconomic factors affect comorbidities. Using three ML models, we achieved 100% recall. SHAP analysis proved that low parental education and income are major drivers of epilepsy and depression risk. This research provides the data needed for equitable healthcare policies."

## 📱 PHONE SCREENSHOT THIS!

**Backup Talking Points:**

**If blank on Slide 20:**
"SHAP analysis revealed that blue dots—representing low socioeconomic status—consistently push predictions higher for epilepsy and depression, while red dots—high SES—push them lower. This quantifies the exact influence."

**If asked "So what?":**
"This research moves us from knowing disparities exist to measuring exactly how much they matter, enabling targeted interventions."

**If asked "What's next?":**
"Longitudinal studies to establish causation, and policy simulation modeling to test interventions before implementation."
